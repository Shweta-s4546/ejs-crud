# Project Working steps

## After connecting template engines

1. Fisrt make sure that mongo db connected
2. Next step is we need to create a darabase schema in model
    a. open usermodel
    b. design the db schema (which includes field names of table and data types) ex: user-> filename = datatype
    name = string 
    emial= string
    mobile = string
    age = number

    you can continue the fields depend on requirements now we will consider only these 4 fields.
